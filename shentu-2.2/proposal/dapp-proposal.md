## Dear Community Members:

To further ensure the security and stability of our ecosystem, the Foundation proposes an investment of 200,000 CTK for a comprehensive audit and penetration testing of our current and upcoming DAPP tools. As our ecosystem continues to expand, ensuring the security of these tools is not only our responsibility to our users but also a commitment to the future of the entire community and ecosystem.

## Audit Overview

 - **DeepWallet**: A feature-rich browser wallet plugin specifically designed to manage assets within the Cosmos ecosystem. As the primary gateway for users interacting with the Cosmos ecosystem, its security is of paramount importance.

 - **Multisig Walle**t: An intuitive interface for multisig management, supporting most chains within the Cosmos ecosystem. This tool serves not only the Shentu community but also provides support to other Cosmos chains.

- **Auto Staking**: A smart tool that enhances staking returns through automated claim and staking operations, helping users maximize their yields. Given the complexity of its automation features, a thorough security review is crucial.

- **OpenTask**: A decentralized platform that empowers users to create DAOs and publish tasks. With its flexible functionality involving fund management and task execution, the security of OpenTask must be rigorously safeguarded to maintain user trust.

**Key Value of the Audit and Penetration Testing**

- **Enhanced Security**: Through the audit, we can identify and fix potential vulnerabilities in a timely manner, preventing hackers from exploiting them to steal assets or compromise the system, thereby ensuring the safety of community assets and personal information.

- **Increased Trust**: These DAPPs not only serve Shentu Chain but also involve other chains within the Cosmos ecosystem. By conducting an independent third-party audit, we can ensure the security and stability of these tools, further increasing the trust of other communities in our products, and potentially fostering more cross-chain collaborations.

- **Long-Term Sustainability**: Security is the cornerstone of an ecosystem’s sustainability. This audit will further strengthen the security foundation of our DAPPs, ensuring their long-term stable operation, and supporting the continued development of Shentu Chain and its ecosystem.

- **Community Participation**: We will ensure that the entire audit process is transparent and open, with regular progress updates provided to the community. This not only helps to increase community confidence in our work but also encourages more people to participate in the security development of the ecosystem.

 - **Support for Future Development**: As the functions and user demands of DAPPs continue to expand, regular security audits and penetration testing will become the norm. This investment will lay the groundwork for future audit work, positioning Shentu Chain as a leader in security within the blockchain space.

We sincerely invite all community members to vote in favor of this proposal. Your support will help us ensure the security of these four critical DAPPs and create a safer, more reliable environment for Shentu Chain and the broader Cosmos ecosystem.

Thank you for your trust and support, and let’s build a safer decentralized future together!
